      <h1>Coding HTML and CSS</h1>
      <p>
        HTML and CSS are languages that are used to design websites.
        They are so usefull, that they have been around for over 20 years!
        And in the IT world, technology changes so fast that things can become outdated within a year.
        So it is very impressive these languages have been in use for such a long time.
      </p>
      <p>This booth will give you a guide to creating your very own webpage,
        that can tell a story, show your art, or just make people laugh. <span id='middle'>&#9786;</span>
      </p>

      <h1>Requirements</h1>
      <p>You don't need much to start coding, just open your favorite text editor.</p>
      <p>If you are using a windows computer, click the windows key on the bottom left hand corner of your screen, then type 'notepad' and hit enter.</p>
      <p>If you are using a MAC computer, navigate to applications, then click 'TextEdit'.</p>
      <p><span id='middle'>*</span> Ask a mentor at the booth if you need help!</p>
      <p>Next, open up your favorite web-browser. Like Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari.</p>

      <h1>How a Webpage Works</h1>
      <p>The web-browser grabs the HTML file for the website, and any other required files.</p>
      <p>The HTML file tells the web-browser what text to display, and any other files the browser may need to display that content.</p>
      <p>For now we will only have one HTML file.</p>

      <h1>Making the HTML File</h1>
      <p>After opening our favorite text-editor, we will save this file as an HTML file on our Desktop.</p>
      <p>To do this in Windows, click 'File' on the top left corner of notepad, then click 'Save As...'</p>
      <p>Now, navigate to your desktop folder, and save it as 'index.html'.</p>

      <h1>Viewing the Web-Page</h1>
      <p>Open this file in your web-browser, by right-clicking the 'index.html' file on your desktop.</p>
      <p><span id='middle'>*</span> If it does not work, try right-clicking the 'index.html' file, and selecting 'Open With', then choose the web-browser.</p>
      <p>
        When we p our index file, we will be able to view it here.
        As you can see, the webpage is empty!
        This is because we have not written anyhting yet, so lets go back to the notepad file we have open.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id='basic_html' class='section'>
      <h1>Basic HTML</h1>
      <p>Now lets start coding!</p>
      <p>The first thing we will want to do is decide what our webpage will be about.
        Will it be about robots fighting?
        How about Ninjas?
        The only limit is your imagination!
      </p>
      <p>This example is going to be about cats, but feel free to replace it with whatever you want.</p>
      <p>&lt;h1&gt; - this is a header tag, it is used to make a title. Go ahead and type '&lt;h3&gt;Cats!&lt;/h3&gt;' into your index file. Then Save it.</p>
      <p>After saving, go back to your browser window and click the refresh button, or hit 'F5' on your keyboard. You should see the word 'Cats!' in your browser.</p>
      <h1>Add More Content</h1>
      <p>Lets start writing about your subject, wether it be cats or ninjas.</p>
      <p>&lt;p&gt; - this is the paragraph tag, it is used to make small entries of text within a webpage. Go ahead and type your text like this, right below your title, like this;</p>
      <div class='p_sample'>
        <p>
        &lt;h1&gt;Cats!&lt;/h1&gt;
        <br />
        &lt;p&gt;Cats are the dominant domesticated animal of America, and are very fluffy.&lt;/p&gt;
